# Facial Beauty Prediction

Simple website interface built using Flask that allows users to upload selfies to be rated out of 10 by a machine learning model trained on the SCUT-FBP5500 dataset (https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-FBP5500-Database-Release). See model_train_example.py for the script used to train the model, which can definitely be improved. 

To run yourself:

```
python flask_server.py
```
